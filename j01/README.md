# Spotify Web Browser
Spotify is the largest music streaming service that has over 400 million users active around the world. I use the web browser version of Spotify because it has all the features that I need when streaming music. Every week, I use Spotify to find new music.

I use the Discover Weekly playlist that is powered by a Spotify algorithm that suggests new songs based on your listening history and liked songs. This is very **useful** because you don't have to find new music manually but automatically. Please play the video below.

The simplicity of the layout of the website improves the user **satisfaction**. The video shows how simple it is to like a song on the website which the song goes into a playlist of your liked songs. The weakness on the web browser is that there is no sort option for playlists, but it's available on the mobile and desktop application.
