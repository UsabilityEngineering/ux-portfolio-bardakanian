# Spotify Web Browser
I use the web browser version of Spotify because it has all the features that I need for me when streaming music. I use the Discover Weekly playlist that is powered by a Spotify AI algorithm that suggests new songs based on your listening history and liked songs. This is very **useful** because you can find new music seamlessly.

The simplicity of the layout of the website demonstrates an **aesthetic and minimalist design**, which is part of Jakob Nielsen's usability guidelines. This emphasizes the importance of designing interfaces that are streamlined and focused on the user's primary goals, rather than cluttered with irrelevant or rarely needed information. The video shows me how simple it is to like a song on the website by clicking the heart, which allows the song to go into a playlist of your liked songs. The weakness on the web browser is that there is no sort option for playlists, but it's available on the mobile and desktop application.

Let's say I want to make an 80s playlist for an upcoming 80s party. Spotify will already have a playlist of 80s songs that would make my task more **efficient**. I will add the songs from that playlist to my own personal 80s playlist. I need to first create my personal playlist by clicking on the + next to Your Library. I have two options: create a playlist or a playlist folder, and I pick create a playlist.

I add a title and a photo to the playlist. Then, I go back to spotify 80s playlist, and select the songs I want. I go to the three dots shown near the time stamp, I click on it. It shows multiple options which I click on "add to playlist" which the one I to add to is 80s Dance. I can remove the songs from the playlist by clicking the three dots.

In the end, by adding more songs, I created my personalized 80s playlist for my party!
