# Spotify Web Browser
I use the web browser version of Spotify because it has all the features that I need when streaming music. I use the Discover Weekly playlist that is powered by a Spotify AI algorithm that suggests new songs based on your listening history and liked songs. This is very **useful** because you can find new music seamlessly.

The simplicity of the layout of the website demonstrates **aesthetic and minimalist design** which is part of the Jakob Nielsen's usability guideline, emphasizes the importance of designing  interfaces that are streamlined and focused on the user's primary goals, rather than cluttered with irrelevant or rarely needed information. The video shows me how simple it is to like a song on the website by clicking the heart allows the song to go into a playlist of your liked songs. The weakness on the web browser is that there is no sort option for playlists, but it's available on the mobile and desktop application.

Let's say I want to make an 80s playlist for an upcoming 80s party. Spotify will already have a playlist of that.
